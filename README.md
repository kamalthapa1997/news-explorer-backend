# news-explorer-backend

## About the project

This repository serves as the backend for a News App built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The app includes user authentication features for sign-in and sign-out. Authenticated users can save, unsave, and delete articles retrieved from a third-party API. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information and saved articles. The backend provides a secure and efficient foundation for managing user interactions with news articles within the app.
